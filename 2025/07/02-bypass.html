			<h1>Using Soundcloud's API without an App</h1>
			<h2>July 2, 2025 --- 5 Minute Read</h2>
			<hr>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			I primarily use Soundcloud for almost every song I listen to. However, there's no<br>
			rich presence for Discord (like there is for Spotify). Unfortunate, but I can live<br>
			without it. However, I'd like to make it, just as a test. The problem with this, is<br>
			just how <b>bad</b> Soundcloud Support is at giving out their API. You used to just<br>
			fill out a form to do it, but they closed it down a few months ago.<br><br>

			Now, you have to use their terrible "support bot", that claims to create a ticket,<br>
			but just never does. So how do we get around to actually using their API?<br>

			<h3>DevTools</h3>
			Now, Soundcloud does expose their API <a href="https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/explorer/open-api">here</a>. The problem is using the API requires<br>
			both an OAuth2 token and a Client ID. If we can find those, we can use their API.<br>
			I realized that the browser session must be able to know these, if we're able to do<br>
			stuff that the API exposes. Sure enough, looking at a request, we can see the following<br>
			<div class="container">
				<pre>
					<code>
GET https://api-v2.soundcloud.com/me/play-history/tracks?client_id=[client_id]
  ...
Authorization: OAuth [token]
					</code>
				</pre>
		</div>
			Bingo! We now have both things we need. We can just send requests using these two<br>
			things, right? Not exactly. If you paste this exact request (as cURL) into your<br>
			terminal, you'll initally get a HTTP 200 OK. Eventually, you'll get HTTP 403,<br>
			despite the parameters being (for the most part) the same. What's going on here?<br>

			<h3>DataDome: Bot <s>protection</s></h3>
			In between requests, I noticed only one header changed: <code>X-Datadome-ClientID</code>.<br>
			This serves as a bot protection solution, seemingly to prevent people like me from doing<br>
			this. If you take a look at various of the client ID's, you start to notice a pattern:
			<div class="container">
				<pre>
					<code>
xkVkxGvp5lkBiL0A_cuN6xmUlb_uXDhYQOA4PFrDc3f9sZKL7zvOVDnKDwKz2AipGh6HSCx65CnlJBpyXqjgTmUSkVV3Qi8Xueo8gnJTe_uc3~9F0onjLyw~rYJq63Cv
t86praf1JKTfbEmyKQ~Cx2~m1TzhwNjfLaahESKCK~mMHgu11VG~9aIu8s8INH_Fxuv~UguZncpZV47hHZ2dff99eXQrHOc0ivf5wfHihj5si4gpejjqIxjEZXhFQEMT
twFJ_~4ZCOeNfay_yUVMB5ED2RUUGKT~6onBslCMxWaPc2uV97WvV_ywK0_778z_~28zSWlBgkmSsCknLfc3pJeAaRHP0jUh0_A0ZU4ItdoqPeIG_T1p2AUBHihSFiMM
					</code>
				</pre>
			</div>

			I noticed a couple things looking at this:
			<ol>
				<li>Each client ID is 128 characters long</li>
				<li>It uses the alphabet, and numbers seemingly randomly</li>
				<li>There's anywhere from 6 - 9 seperators (<code>_~</code>, <code>_</code> or <code>~</code>)</li>
			</ol>

			This makes my job of writing a bypass super easy. All I need to do is generate the new<br>
			(spoofed) client ID, with those rules. It took genuienly around 5-10 minutes to do.<br>

			<h3>The Bypass</h3>
			The bypass code literally looks like this:
			<div class="container">
				<pre>
					<code>
	def regenerate_clientid() -> str:
		target_length = 128
		alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789"
		seperator_count = randint(6,9)
		every = int(target_length/seperator_count)
		seperators = ["~", "_", "~_"]
		i = 0
		string = ""
		while i < 129:
			if i % every == 0 and i != 0:
				chosen = randint(0, len(seperators)-1)
				string += seperators[chosen]
				i += len(seperators[chosen])
			string += alphabet[randint(0, len(alphabet)-1)]
			i += 1
					</code>
				</pre>
			</div>
			It's fairly simple, and works about 60-80% of the time (converges to around 65.7%),<br>
			which is good enough for this project, as Soundcloud doesn't seem to <a href="https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/rate-limits">have a rate limit!</a><br>
			Anyways, it's very simple to use, and the way I used it in my rich presence looked like this:
			<div class="container">
				<pre>
					<code>
	headers['x-datadome-clientid'] = regenerate_clientid()
	r = requests.get(request_url, headers=headers)
	while r.status_code != 200:
		headers['x-datadome-clientid'] = regenerate_clientid()
		print("Redoing request...", end="")
		r = requests.get(request_url, headers=headers)
		print(r.status_code)
					</code>
				</pre>
			</div>
			
			That's pretty much all there is to it!

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			Thanks for reading! This was a short blog, slightly rushed but I hope everything was understandable.<br>
			I'll go back to low level stuff later, but I got slightly sidetracked with this project.
